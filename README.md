![What is it?](/Assets/what.png)

**UNDERTALE Dialogue Creator** is a tool for modding **UNDERTALE**. It takes a string as input, and converts it into a string that you can copy and paste into the **data.win** file for UNDERTALE using [**UNDERTALE Modding Tool**](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool). The string will then work as actual dialogue in UNDERTALE, without you having to edit the string afterwards.

![How do You Use it?](/Assets/how.png)

As of now, the tool is unfinished, but once it is complete enough to release, a guide will be implemented. In the meantime, here are my findings for the inner workings of the UNDERTALE text system.

``` none
G in brackets is Gold Amount
I in brackets is current ITEM (used when dropping items)
1-9 in brackets refer to arguments 1-9 (these are temporary variables for specific dialogue or text, such as how much gold you gain or what armor Papyrus tells Undyne you were wearing)
\(capital letter) changes the color of text to the right of it to that color (\X changes it back to white)
^(number) changes the text speed
& begins a new line in textbox and battle dialogue
# begins a new line in the intro cutscene and naming screen text
```
**NOTE: Upon downloading the release, the user may be required to download and install a font file. If this is required, a guide will be supplied for this as well.**
